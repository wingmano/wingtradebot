# Requirements Document

## Introduction

We need to get this TradingView webhook server ready for Git with a lightweight, simple setup that syncs fast and uses minimal resources. The server takes webhook signals from TradingView, executes trades through SimpleFX API, and has a web dashboard. Focus is on basic git functionality without heavy security overhead that slows down commits.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all sensitive data secured before pushing to Git, so API keys and passwords never get exposed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Git THEN create .gitignore that blocks all sensitive files
2. WHEN config has secrets THEN move API keys and passwords to environment variables
3. WHEN database files exist THEN exclude .db files and logs from Git
4. WHEN SSL certs exist THEN keep certificate files out of the repo
5. WHEN committing THEN do basic sensitive file check without heavy validation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a lightweight repo that syncs fast with minimal resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Git THEN exclude node_modules, dist, logs, and temp files
2. WHEN committing THEN use minimal pre-commit checks that run quickly
3. WHEN syncing GitHub THEN transfer only essential files
4. WHEN cloning repo THEN use minimal disk space and bandwidth
5. WHEN running git operations THEN avoid resource-intensive validation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want basic environment variable configuration without complex validation that slows startup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN show simple error messages
3. WHEN configuration templates are provided THEN include .env.example with required variables
4. WHEN validating config THEN do basic checks without heavy processing
5. WHEN API keys are configured THEN validate only essential variables

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple git configuration that works reliably without complex security setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Git is configured THEN set up basic user info and repository settings
2. WHEN commits are made THEN use standard git workflow without GPG signing requirements
3. WHEN branches are managed THEN use simple branching strategy
4. WHEN collaborating THEN use basic git practices without complex security
5. WHEN syncing THEN prioritize speed and reliability over advanced security

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want minimal documentation that covers essential setup without overwhelming detail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing docs THEN include concise README with project overview
2. WHEN documenting setup THEN provide quick start instructions
3. WHEN describing features THEN list main functionality briefly
4. WHEN providing examples THEN show essential commands only
5. WHEN writing text THEN keep it short and practical
